# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, we strongly encourage you to report it responsibly and privately.

### 📧 How to Report

Please send all vulnerability reports to:

[**contact@sszczep.dev**](mailto:contact@sszczep.dev)

Alternatively, you may open a **private security advisory** through the project’s GitHub repository:

[**https://github.com/sszczep/homeassistant-grenton/security/advisories**](https://github.com/sszczep/homeassistant-grenton/security/advisories)

### 🔒 Responsible Disclosure

Please **do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have confirmed and addressed it.  
Early disclosure may put existing users at risk.

### 🛠 Security Issue Handling

Once a vulnerability is confirmed:

1. We assign a **severity rating** (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
2. We begin **patch development** for firmware, or documentation  
3. We prepare a **coordinated disclosure timeline** with you  
4. A fix is published along with a **security advisory**  
5. Credits are provided to reporters (optional and only with consent)

### 🧪 What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate efficiently, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Affected firmware version
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior  
- Impact assessment (if known)  
- Any proof-of-concept code, test scripts
